# clone-org-repos
-------------------------

clone-org-repos allows you to clone all the repos for a github organisation

This script is a useful way to backup an organisation's repos

It's very hacked together, and will probably only work on Linux machines. If you run into any issues or have any comments/questions/concerns, please file an issue!

Usage:
```
./cloneOrgRepos.sh organisation_name
```
